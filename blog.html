            How Will Nepal Benefit if it Turns Completely Towards All-electric Transport ?

           <p> Well for other countries going all electric is 
               a hot trend and a way to save environment. Having said all these how will 
               our own country Nepal benefit shifting from all-gasoline to all-electric 
               transport/vehicle if we do so. Many say its all about saving environment and stopping
                green house emission but have anyone noticed that the shift will 
               be more gain to our country in other sector than just environmental issues.</p> <br>
               <h3>
                1.COUNTRY'S ECONOMY:
               </h3> <br>
               <p>
                Our Country is importing around 40,000,000 L of petrol, 142,000,000 L
                 of diesel and 1,700,000 L kerosene monthly worth around $1 billion 
                 (Rs.10000 crore) which comprises about 20% of total annual import of our
                  country which is around $5.5 billion (RS.55000 crore). Well if we go all-electric
                   we would not only be saving that amount but also depreciate the annual import by
                   
                about 20% which results reduction of trade deficit. That amount can be invested in
                 production of more electricity to ensure no electricity shortage in near future and 
                 if exceeds can be exported to nearby countries or that amount can be invested in
                  establishing Battery plant.
